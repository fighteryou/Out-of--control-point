# Out-of--control-point
To find points that were out of control among a batch of samples

This intended to be a help for my best friend whose major was machinery manufacturing.
They had a batch of steel products and what teacher needed them to do was finishing a simple
program which could judge if there was any steel below the standard.

The standard is very simple. There was a range for both, the standard deviation and The range.
The range would be (average-3value,average+value), and this value can be standard deviation or The range.
Only two kinds of jugdements passed can any of samples reach to standard.

And this program allows you to input the data of samples and show you all the samples and the range of 
standard and which one is below the standard, based on java user interface design.
